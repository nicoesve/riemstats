# Introduction

The `riemstats` package provides specialized statistical methods for analyzing brain connectivity matrices (connectomes) from multi-site neuroimaging studies. When working with functional or structural connectivity data represented as symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, this package offers both harmonization techniques to address site-specific effects and ANOVA methods that respect the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices.

## The Multi-Site Connectome Challenge

Modern neuroimaging studies often collect brain connectivity data across multiple sites to increase sample size and generalizability. However, this introduces significant challenges associated to the fact that different scanners, protocols, and populations introduce systematic biases.

Traditional statistical methods fail to address these challenges simultaneously, either ignoring the geometric structure of SPD matrices or lacking appropriate harmonization capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

`riemstats` addresses these challenges through two complementary sets of tools:

1. **Harmonization Methods**: Remove unwanted site/scanner effects while preserving biological signals
  - ComBat harmonization adapted for SPD matrices (see Honorro et al.)
  - Rigid geometric alignment methods (see Simeon et al.)

2. **ANOVA Methods**: Test for group differences while respecting SPD geometry
  - Fr√©chet ANOVA using Riemannian distances (see Muller et al.)
  - Riemannian ANOVA (closer to classical MANOVA, see Escobar, Harezlak.)
    - Wilks' lambda and Pillai's trace statistics on the tangent space  
    - Bootstrap inference for robust significance testing

By integrating harmonization and ANOVA within a Riemannian framework, `riemstats` enables rigorous statistical analysis of multi-site connectome data while preserving the geometric properties that make these matrices meaningful representations of brain connectivity.
